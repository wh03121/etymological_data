          <p class="lead mb-5 text-white-50">This website is the culmination of my semester project for LING 3630. Using the free version of the massive iWeb corpus and data gathered by Gerard Melo of UC Berkeley, this website does one simple thing: given two words, it will tell you if they are related, and (depending on the available information) how they are related.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This website is built on top of a group of Python classes I wrote.
        They are heavily object-oriented and rely on two separate SQLite databases.
        The current functionality of this website does not utilze the iWeb Corpus databse,
        however, I plan to extend this project further in the future.
        <br /><br/>
        These Python classes are highly accessible and can be implemented in numerous different
        types of software. This website, for example, is one showcase of how easy it is to interface
        with my classes. Running this website takes just under 100 lines of code--including whitespace.
        Interfacing with the databases and performing search functions, checking word relation, etc.
        takes about 20 times that amount of code--not including the databases, which are so large
        I was unable to upload them to GitHub because they were too large.
        <br/><br/>
        This website will not tell you if words have the meaning or are conceptually related (for example, "male" and "female" will return as not related because they come from different origins, even though they are highly conceptually related).
